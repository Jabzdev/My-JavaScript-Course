      ARRAYS

      Arrays are JavaScriptâ€™s way of making lists.
      Arrays can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans).
      Like lists, arrays are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position.

      Note:
      *The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
      *Each content item inside an array is called an element.
      *There are three different elements inside the array.
      *Each element inside the array is a different data type.
    */

    //Example 1
    let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

    console.log(newYearsResolutions);


    //Updating Elements
    let groceryList = ['bread', 'tomatoes', 'milk'];

    groceryList[1] = 'avocados';

    console.log(groceryList);

    /*
      Arrays with let and const

      *Variables declared with let can be reassigned.
      *Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.

    //Example
    let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Soy Sauce', 'Sriracha'];

    const utensils = ['Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks', 'Spork'];

    condiments[0] = 'Mayo';
    console.log(condiments);
    condiments = ['Mayo'];
    console.log(condiments);

    utensils[3] = 'Spoon';
    console.log(utensils);
