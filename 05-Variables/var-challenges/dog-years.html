      Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

      Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

      The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
      Each year following equates to 4 dog years.

    // My age.
    const myAge = 25;
    console.log(myAge);


    let earlyYears = 2;
    console.log(earlyYears);
    earlyYears *= 10.5;
    console.log(earlyYears);

    let laterYears = myAge - 2;
    console.log(laterYears);
    laterYears *= 4;
    console.log(laterYears);

    let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
    console.log(myAgeInDogYears);

    const myName = 'Jabz Dev'.toLowerCase();
    console.log(myName); 

    console.log(`My name is ${myName}. Iam ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
